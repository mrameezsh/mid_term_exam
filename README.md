Question # 01:
Create a class called "BankAccount" with the following attributes and methods:
● account_number (integer)
● balance (double)
● account_type (string)
● interest_rate (double)
● deposit(amount): adds the amount to the balance.
● withdraw(amount): subtracts the amount from the balance. You cannot withdraw
more than the current balance.
● add_interest(): adds interest to the balance based on the interest rate.
● display(): prints out the account number, balance, account type, and interest rate.
Then, create two instances of the BankAccount class, each with its own account number,
balance, account type, and interest rate.
Finally, call the deposit(), withdraw(), add_interest(), and display() methods on each instance
and confirm that the information is updated and displayed correctly.

● add_course(course): adds a course to the student's list of courses.
● drop_course(course): removes a course from the student's list of courses.
● display_courses(): prints out the student's list of courses.
Then, create two instances of the Student class, each with their name, id, and courses.
Finally, call the add_course(), drop_course(), and display_courses() methods on each
instance and confirm that the information is updated and displayed correctly.
